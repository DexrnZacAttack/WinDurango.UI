# WinDurango.UI
GUI for WinDurango, which is planned to allow for easy installing/patching among other random stuff I decide lmfao

> [!NOTE]
> This does nothing more than provide a GUI for easily registering and patching packages with WinDurango.   
> Additionally, I don't know much about C#... so the code is probably very messy.

## Todo
 - [X] Make the applist not go offscreen (lol)
 - [ ] Applist pages
 - [ ] Fix icon in the titlebar
 - [ ] Allow for search
 - [ ] Resize content to fit to screen
 - [ ] Allow for package removal from UI instead of just completely uninstalling, as well as allowing for any existing installed package to be added
 - [ ] Compiling the DLLs and patching automatically
 - [ ] Dropdown button instead of just an install button (so you can install without symlinking dlls, add existing packages, etc)
 - [ ] Repo contributors on the about screen
 - [ ] Get Fluent Thin working
 - [ ] Add versioning to the InstalledPackages json
 - [ ] Make the Package stuff not rely on UI so much, handle that somewhere else.
 - [ ] Fix crash when installation errors
 - [ ] Cleanup, lots and lots of it.
